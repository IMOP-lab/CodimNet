The proposed CodimNet is an advanced model for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on EEG.  This network combines multi-branch feature extraction, designed according to the anatomical segmentation of the international 10-20 system, with the Neurodynamic Physics-Informed Neural Network (ND-PINN) to better capture the characteristics of EEG signals in AD patients.  It outperforms nine other methods on the CAUEEG dataset, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in AD identification.
## Installation

We run CodimNet and previous methods on a system running Ubuntu 22.04, with Python 3.8, PyTorch 2.1.0, and CUDA 12.1.

## Experiment

### Models Evaluation Without Cross-Validation

CodimNet attaining peak performance across key classification metrics—Acc (76.27\%), AUC (85.27\%), and Sp (88.28\%)—outperforming its closest competitor, EEGNet, with a Se enhancement of 0.29 percentage points, an F1-score improvement of 2.07 percentage points, and a G-Mean augmentation of 1.89 percentage points, indicative of its enhanced robustness in mitigating class imbalance effects intrinsic to medical datasets.
